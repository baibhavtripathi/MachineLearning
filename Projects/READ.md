**Iris Flowers Classification ML Project– Learn about Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms**

Objective :-  The goal of this machine learning project is to classify the flowers into among the 
              three species – 
                      virginica, 
                      setosa, or
                      versicolor 
               based on length and width of petals and sepals.
